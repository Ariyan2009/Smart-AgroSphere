            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This system uses artificial intelligence to analyze weather data, soil moisture, and crop type to optimize irrigation schedules, saving water and enhancing crop yield. By using machine learning algorithms, the system can make real-time decisions about when and how much water is needed.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The AI-powered system analyzes data from multiple sources:
                <ul>
                    <li>Weather forecasts: To determine rainfall predictions and adjust irrigation accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Soil moisture levels: To monitor if the soil is too dry or wet, optimizing water usage.</li>
                    <li>Crop type: Different crops require different irrigation needs, and the AI adjusts accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
                The system processes this data in real-time and activates the pumps only when necessary, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time.
            </p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> By delivering water only when needed, the system reduces water wastage.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Crop Yield:</strong> Ensures that crops receive optimal watering, leading to better growth and yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Reduces the cost of water bills by using water efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong> Can be monitored and controlled remotely, making it easier for farmers to manage irrigation systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Data Analysis:</strong> The system uses AI to make data-driven decisions in real-time, improving the accuracy of irrigation schedules.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Initial Cost:</strong> The setup, including Raspberry Pi, sensors, and AI models, can be expensive initially.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependency on Internet:</strong> The system relies on a stable internet connection for remote monitoring and data analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular maintenance is required to ensure the sensors and pumps are functioning properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Complex Setup:</strong> Setting up the AI model and connecting all components might be complex for some users.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Forecast Dependency:</strong> If the weather forecast is inaccurate, it could affect the irrigation schedule.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
