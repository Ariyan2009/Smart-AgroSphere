            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This IoT-enabled system automates irrigation using soil moisture sensors and allows remote control and monitoring via a web interface, mobile app, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. It ensures that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time, reducing water waste and enhancing efficiency.

            <h2>Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module</li>
                <li>Soil Moisture Sensor</li>
                <li>Water Pump</li>
                <li>Two-Channel Relay Module</li>
                <li>Light Bulb (for visual feedback)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture levels in the soil. When the moisture falls below a certain threshold, the system activates the water pump to irrigate the plants. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module connects the system to the internet, allowing users to monitor and control the system remotely via a web interface, mobile app, or voice commands using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                The system can be enhanced by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding more sensors for temperature, humidity, and light to provide more comprehensive environmental monitoring.</li>
                    <li>Integrating a solar panel for sustainable power usage, making the system more eco-friendly.</li>
                    <li>Implementing advanced algorithms for better irrigation control based on weather forecasts and soil conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                The next step is to integrate the IoT irrigation system with a full-scale farm management system that includes more sensors and features such as fertilizer management and pest control.
